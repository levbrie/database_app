	            Each slide is composed by <img> and .info
	            - .info's position is customized with css in index.css
	            - each <img> parallax effect is declared by the following params inside its class:
	            
	            example: class="asset left-472 sp600 t120 z3"
	            left-472 means left: -472px from the center
	            sp600 is speed transition
	            t120 is top to 120px
	            z3 is z-index to 3
	            Note: Maintain this order of params

	            For the backgrounds, you can combine from the bgs folder :D
